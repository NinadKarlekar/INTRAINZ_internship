# Data Science Project
## Recommender System

If you have tried online shopping, you must have noticed that when you are checking out a product on an eCommerce site, there is a list of suggested products that you are presented with. In this project, you will work on different types of recommendation systems

## Life cycle of Machine learning Project

## Dataset information
- InvoiceNo: This is the number that identifies a transaction.
- Stock Code: This refers to the product ID.
- Description: This describes the product that a user purchased.
- Quantity: It specified the quantity of the item purchased.
- InvoiceDate: The date on which the transaction took place.
- UnitPrice: Price of one product.
- CustomerID: It identifies the customer.
- Country: The country where the transaction was performed.

## We will be developing two recommendation models using the given dataset:-

1. **Recommendation system for customer**
- The first model is aimed towards providing **recommendations to customers based on their past purchases**.
- We will be building a system that **recommends products to a specific customer**.

2. **Recommendation system for Shopkeepers**

- The second model is **targeted towards shopkeepers**.
- **It will suggest products that are likely to be purchased by a customer**, based on their past purchase history.

- By building these two models, we aim to provide personalized recommendations to both customers and shopkeepers, which would ultimately enhance their shopping experience.
